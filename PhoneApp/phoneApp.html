            <p id="introduction2">
                Congratulations, you have the opportunity to test out our new app called Mirra.<br><br>
                You can use our app to take photos of your friends, random people, or even just yourself (we call these people your photo subjects)
                 and thanks to our state of the art AI you can apply a large assortment of filters to those photos to see how they'd look like
                  if they were older, more fit, wearing a new outfit, trying out a different hairstyle, etc.<br><br>
                  To be clear they only change the photos, not your photo subjects.<br><br>
                As to avoid overwhelming our servers, we can't let everyone use all our filters and features at once, so we came up with a solution
                 that will let you purchase the functions you're interested in, using a credit score system.<br> We'll give you 150 credits to start you out with,
                  it should be enough to purchase most basic filters, but don't worry about using more than that,
                   later on you'll have ways to raise your credit score by supporting our company in some way, or by proving that you're a trustworthy person.
                  <br><br>Created by TryptophanDealer (https://www.reddit.com/u/TryptophanDealer) contact me if you want your art removed from my cyoa, or if you just want to say hi.
                  <br><br>You have to be at least 18 years old to play this, you have been warned.

                What you have to write and where you're going to write it will mostly be decided by chance, you will get the chance to re-roll, if you don't like what you ended up with, but be careful there is always a chance that your next roll is going to be worse than you have now.<br>
                You can get more rolls by taking up additional challenges. Keep in mind that each roll will only cost one re-roll even if you re-rolled everything.
